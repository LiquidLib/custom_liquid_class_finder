# Enhanced Logging Features

## Overview

The protocol now includes comprehensive logging output that will appear in the simulation log, providing real-time visibility into the optimization process. This allows you to monitor the gradient descent algorithm as it works and understand how parameters are being adjusted.

## Logging Sections

### 1. Initial Setup Logging

```
============================================================
LIQUID CLASS OPTIMIZATION STARTED
============================================================
Testing 10 wells with P1000 pipette
Liquid type: GLYCEROL_99
Reference parameters: {'aspiration_rate': 150.0, ...}

============================================================
```

**What it shows:**
- Protocol configuration
- Initial parameters
- Optimization settings

### 2. Per-Well Processing Logging

For each well, you'll see:

#### Parameter Generation
```
--- WELL 1/10: A1 ---
Using reference liquid class parameters for first well
Current parameters: {'aspiration_rate': 150.0, ...}
```

**For subsequent wells:**
```
Previous scores: 3.027 -> 2.752
Calculated gradients: {'aspiration_rate': -0.1, 'dispense_rate': -0.1, ...}
Learning rate: 0.1000
Parameter changes:
  aspiration_rate: 150.00 -> 149.90 (Δ-0.10)
  dispense_rate: 150.00 -> 149.90 (Δ-0.10)
  blowout_rate: 100.00 -> 99.95 (Δ-0.05)
```

#### Execution and Evaluation

```

#### Learning Rate Adjustments
```
📉 Reducing learning rate: 0.1000 -> 0.0950
```

#### Progress Summary
